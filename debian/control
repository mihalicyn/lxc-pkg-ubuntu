Description: Linux Containers userspace tools
 Containers are insulated areas inside a system, which have their own namespace
 for filesystem, network, PID, IPC, CPU and memory allocation and which can be
 created using the Control Group and Namespace features included in the Linux
 kernel.
 .
 This package provides the lxc-* tools, which can be used to start a single
 daemon in a container, or to boot an entire "containerized" system, and to
 manage and debug your containers.
