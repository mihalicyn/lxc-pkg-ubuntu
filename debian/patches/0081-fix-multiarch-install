Description: When installing a non-native architecture, the template
 installs a bunch of packages of the native architecture to work around
 existing limitations of qemu-user-static, mostly related to netlink.
 .
 The current code would install upstart of the host architecture but
 force the amd64 version of the others. This was just a mistake done
 while testing/developping the code. Fixing now to always install
 the native architecture version of all of them.
